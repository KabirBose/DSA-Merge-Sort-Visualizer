# Documentation

This is just a "Get Started" guide. The full documentation is in the file named **Assignment 2 Report.pdf**

# Getting Started

1. Enter the directory where the `merge-sort.py` file exists
2. Using your terminal, enter `python3 merge-sort.py`
3. If you want to sort your own array, head over to `merge-sort.py` and change line 53 to whatever dataset you desire
4. Hope everything is _sorted_ out :)
