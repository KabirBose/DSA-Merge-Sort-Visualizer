# Merge Sort

### by Kabir Bose

# Objective

Sorting a given a dataset consisting of an array of product IDs with merge sort, by showing every iteration for the algorithm. After each iteration a sound effect is played.

# Documentation

This is just a "Get Started" guide. The full documentation is in the file named **Assignment 2 Report.pdf**

# Getting Started

1. Enter the directory where the `merge-sort.py` file exists
2. Using your terminal, enter `python3 merge-sort.py`
3. The merge sort process will start on the dataset
4. After each iteration, a sound effect will play
5. If you want to sort your own array, head over to `merge-sort.py` and change line 53 to whatever dataset you desire
6. Hope everything is _sorted_ out :)
